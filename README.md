# Cycling Safety Vest

Cycle safely with the cycling safety vest. The vest uses an Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit to drive a series of Neopixel strips attached to the rear of the vest. The Circuit Playground pairs wirelessly using Bluetooth with a control module based around an ESP32 that resides on the handlebars of the bike. The ESP32 takes inputs from buttons and sensors on the handlebars to determine if the rider is turning or braking. These inputs are then relayed to the vest, which displays braking or turning indicators to drivers, other cyclists, and pedestrians using the Neopixel strips.
